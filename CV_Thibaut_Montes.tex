\runsubsection{Senior Machine Learning Researcher}
\descript{| Talkwalker}
\location{ Mai 2021 - Now | Luxembourg, Luxembourg}
Talkwalker is a Consumer Intelligence Acceleration platform for brands to drive business impact and revenue. I work in the \textbf{AI $\&$ Machine Learning} team responsible to extract information from raw data coming from social medias (text, images, podcasts, videos, etc). More specifically, I use deep neural networks in order to solve \textbf{NLP} related problems. Here are some examples of my projects: $ $
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item[\diamond] Train models using \textbf{pre-trained multilingual transformers models} for aspect-based sentiment analysis or emotion prediction.
	\item[\diamond] \textbf{Meta and Active Learning} based training to improve classifiers accuracy when fewer labelled documents are available.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Desk Strat}
\descript{| Deutsche Bank}
\location{ Sep 2020 - April 2021 | London, United-Kingdom}
I worked on the Synthetic Desk's (ETFs and Indices) migration to Kannon (New P$\&$L and Risk tool used by trading). My main tasks was to improve PV and Risk computations of ETFs and indices.

\runsubsection{Research Advisor}
\descript{| The Independent Calculation Agent (now Opensee)}
\location{ May 2016 - Mar 2020 | Paris, France}
First as an intern, then as a PhD candidate, I worked in collaboration with ICA on the following projects:
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item[\diamond] Optimization of the analytic library using Optimal Quantization (Pricing of Exotic Options in the interest rate world).
	\item[\diamond] Identifying and \textit{killing} bias in xVA computation using Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{PhD in Numerical Probability}
\descript{| LPSM | Sorbonne University}
\location{Mar 2017 – Jun 2020}
I was under the direction of \textbf{Gilles Pagès} and \textbf{Vincent Lemaire} at the LPSM and the supervision of \textbf{Jean-Michel Fayolle} at ICA.

\vspace{0.2cm}
During my PhD, I made contributions to the theoretical study and financial applications of \textbf{Optimal Quantization}, also known as K-means. I also had a keen interest for \textbf{Multilevel Monte-Carlo} methods and \textbf{Stochastic Algorithms}.
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item[\diamond] First, I focused on the numerical optimization of the problem (fixed point search and gradient descent) in order to efficiently build such quantizers.
	\item[\diamond] Then, I applied this numerical method for the pricing of PRDC bermudan options or the study of a Stationary Heston model.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Desk Strat}
\descript{| Deutsche Bank}
\location{ Sep 2020 - Now | London, United-Kingdom}
Working on the Synthetic Desk's (ETFs and Indices) migration to Kannon (New P$\&$L and Risk tool used by trading). My main tasks were:
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item[\diamond] Improve PV and Risk computations.
	\item[\diamond] Automatize and stabilize pcf file upload for ETFs/Indices from different sources.
	\item[\diamond] Code optimization.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Research Advisor}
\descript{| The Independent Calculation Agent (ICA)}
\location{ Nov 2016 - Mar 2020 | Paris, France}
As a PhD candidate, I worked in collaboration with ICA on the following projects:
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item[\diamond] Optimization of the analytic library using Optimal Quantization (Pricing of Exotic Options in the interest rate world).
	\item[\diamond] Identifying and \textit{killing} bias in xVA computation using Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods.
	% \item Implementing new regulatory risk measures in the library.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{PhD in Numerical Probability}
\descript{| LPSM | Sorbonne University (former Paris VI)}
\location{Mar 2017 – Jun 2020}
I was under the direction of \textbf{Gilles Pagès} and \textbf{Vincent Lemaire} at the LPSM and the supervision of \textbf{Jean-Michel Fayolle} at ICA.
% My research subjects were \textbf{Optimal Quantization}, also known as K-means, and Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods.

\vspace{0.2cm}
During my PhD, I made some contributions to the theoretical study and financial applications of \textbf{Optimal Quantization}, also known as K-means. I also had a keen interest for Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods and Stochastic Algorithms.
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item[\diamond] First, I focused on the numerical optimization of the problem (fixed point search and gradient descent) in order to efficiently build such quantizers.
	\item[\diamond] Then, I applied this numerical method for the pricing of PRDC bermudan options or the study of a Stationary Heston model.
\end{tightemize}

% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Professional Experience}

\runsubsection{Quantitative Analyst}
\descript{| The Independent Calculation Agent}
\location{ From Nov 2016 | Paris, France}
As PhD candidate in collaboration with The ICA, I worked on the following projects:
% \vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Optimizing the ICA's analytic library using Optimal Quantization based methods (Pricing of Exotic Options in the interest rate world).
\item Identifying and \textit{killing} bias in the xVA computation using Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods.
\item Implementing new regulatory risk measures in the library.
\end{tightemize}

\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Intern}
\descript{| The Independent Calculation Agent}
\location{May 2016 – Oct 2016 | Paris, France}
The goal of my internship was to optimize financial products price and risk measures sensitivities computations. I investigated both Malliavin calculus and finite differences methods and concluded the latter offered the best optimization.  
%First the idea was to use Malliavin calculus but given the interest rate model, the best solution was to use finite difference.
% I worked on the following projects:
% %\vspace{\topsep}
% \begin{tightemize}
% \item Proof-reading "Optimal transport Methods in Economics", Alfred Galichon's 2016 published book.
% \item Developing networks applications from the book in R. 
% \item Reproducing Chiappori et al (2012)'s results using a matching method developed by Arnaud Dupuy, Alfred Galichon and Yifei Sun.
% \end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Intern}
\descript{| LPSM (former LPMA), under the direction of Daphné Giorgi and Vincent Lemaire}
\location{Jun 2015 – Jul 2015 | Paris, France}
% \vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
% \begin{tightemize}
% \item .
% \item Led and shipped Yoda - the admin interface for the new Phoenix platform. 
% \item Full-stack developer - Wrote and reviewed code for JS using Backbone, Jade, Stylus and Require and Scala using Play
% \end{tightemize}
I explored short rate models (Vasicek Model) and their numerical simulation using trinomial trees. The results of the project can be accessed at the following link: \href{http://simulations.lpsm.paris/trinomial_trees/}{\bf Trinomial Trees Simulation}
